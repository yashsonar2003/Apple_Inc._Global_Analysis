### Business Challenges Identified:-

    - Slightly lower performance in regions like **India and Africa suggests untapped growth potential.**

    - Heavy reliance on similar pricing margins across products limits flexibility during market shocks.
    - **Seasonal dependency (August & December peaks) creates uneven revenue flow.**

### Conclusion:-
